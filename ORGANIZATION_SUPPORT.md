# Enhanced GitHub Organization Support

This implementation now provides better support for GitHub Organizations, addressing the issue of including organization repositories where the user has made contributions, including private repositories.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Repository Detection
- **Owner Type Detection**: Uses `__typename` to distinguish between Organization and User repositories
- **Private Repository Support**: Includes `isPrivate` flag to identify and properly handle private repositories
- **Contribution-Focused**: Only includes organization repositories where the user has actually made contributions

### 2. Better API Queries
- **Enhanced GraphQL Queries**: New `enhanced_contrib_repos()` query with better organization support
- **Efficient Processing**: Focuses on repositories with user contributions rather than all organization repositories
- **Permission-Aware**: Handles private repository access based on token permissions

### 3. Improved Statistics
- **Repository Classification**: Better breakdown between user repositories and organization repositories
- **Private Repository Logging**: Debug logging to help identify private repository access issues
- **Organization Membership**: Display of organizations the user belongs to

## Requirements for Organization Support

### GitHub Token Permissions
To access organization repositories, especially private ones, your `ACCESS_TOKEN` must have:

- `repo` scope - for accessing private repositories
- `read:org` scope - for reading organization membership

### Token Creation
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `read:org` (Read org and team membership, read org projects)
3. Add the token as a repository secret named `ACCESS_TOKEN`

## Usage

The enhanced organization support works automatically when:
1. Your token has the required permissions
2. You are a member of organizations
3. You have made contributions to organization repositories

The statistics will now include:
- Organization repositories where you have contributed
- Private organization repositories (with proper permissions)
- Better classification of user vs organization repositories
- Detailed organization membership information

## Debugging

If organization repositories are not appearing:
1. Check token permissions (`repo` and `read:org` scopes)
2. Verify organization membership
3. Look for debug logs about private repository access
4. Ensure you have made actual contributions to the organization repositories

## Example Output

The enhanced statistics will show:
```
Repositories with contributions: 45
  - User repositories: 20
  - Organization repositories: 25
Organizations: Company A, Company B, Open Source Org
```

This provides a more complete picture of your GitHub activity across organizations.
